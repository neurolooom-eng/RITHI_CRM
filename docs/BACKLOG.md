# RITHI CRM — Backlog

Living backlog for the Field Service module. Newest decisions at the top of each
section. Shipped items also appear in the in-app **Version History**; this file
tracks what's **done**, **in progress**, and **queued**.

## ✅ Done

### Platform & data
- CallReg Apps Script bridge (standalone, opens sheets by ID; JSONP-safe reads
  and writes). Endpoints: ping, tabs, list, parties/products/items, prodsearch,
  auth, users, config/setconfig/configcheck, pending, crnrequest, setucn,
  getview/setview, add/update, reportget/report, tabmeta/tabappend, upload,
  master/masters/setmasters.
- Versioned default Web App URL baked into the app (clients auto-adopt on bump).
- Local caching with 30-min force-sync and "synced X ago"; force-update button.

### Calls
- Field Call Register — live against the FIELD tab; new calls get a UCN written
  back. Installation Calls — live against INST (same schema, I-type UCN).
- Party → Product → Serial cascade picker (Party + Product Master) auto-fills.
- Add Field Call: today's dates defaulted; warranty/contract freeze once loaded
  from Product Master; section reorder persists.
- Call Registration Request → 2026-CRNRequest; Pending Registrations (Hotline)
  registers UCN-less Data-2026 rows, mapping warranty/contract, back-fills UCN.
- **Call reporting** (replaces the standalone Call Updation view): "Update Call"
  on every Field/Installation call → Reporting-N tab, keyed by UCN.
  - Sectioned by Call Status: Solved (full report + manual report upload + spare
    consumption → v2Consumption + customer feedback → v2Feedback), Unsolved
    (pending reason only), Report Pending (reason auto-set).

### Access & roles
- User Master login (AL / Gmail ID, set-password-first, Validity=TRUE only).
- Role-based call visibility (engineer = own calls; RM = reporting sub-tree;
  admin = all).
- Admin **"View as"** engineer preview (persistent banner + exit).

### Masters
- **Party Master** — wired (cascade + live datalist in the intake & request forms).
- **Product Master** — wired (cascade + Product Master view + register-from-row).
- Generic master-value layer: `master` endpoint + `useMaster` hook + Admin Config
  → **Master Value Lists** editor (id / tab / column per master).

### UX
- All tables: column show/hide/reorder/resize (⚙ lists every schema field),
  saved views (per-user + admin "Save for everyone"), ⚑ Filters (top toolbar).
- Mobile & tablet responsive (off-canvas sidebar ≤1024px, full-screen drawers on
  phones, touch targets, no sideways scroll).
- Collapsible sidebar + nav groups (persisted); in-app Version History; sticky
  build footer.

## 🔜 In progress / Next

- **Standard Complaint Master** — mapped to *200 All Masters* → tab
  "Standard Complaint", col "Standard Complaint" (baked as the `complaint`
  master default). Live once CallReg is redeployed; the Standard Complaint field
  fills from this list.
- **Call Type Master** — form wiring done (Call Type select on the Request form
  sources from it); **awaiting the sheet link/tab/column** for the `calltype`
  master (defaults to FIELD / INSTALLATION CALL until then).

---

## 📋 Queued (from the Service_CRM intent)

- **Spare module** — 26-SpareRequestRegister linked to calls (spare request →
  approval → consumption already partly covered by report-time v2Consumption).
- Link remaining masters to call registration (Contract Entry, Warranty Sale
  Entry, ITEM Master, "200 All Masters").
- Preventive Maintenance (PM) schedule/calls.
- Sale Entry, Reports, Dashboard/KPI, Indoor Activity, other misc (to be placed).

## 🔧 Operational notes / blockers

- **Redeploy CallReg** after backend changes (latest adds report/reportget,
  tabmeta/tabappend, upload, master/masters/setmasters). Upload needs the Drive
  scope → re-authorise on redeploy. Send the new /exec URL to bump the default.
- **v2Consumption / v2Feedback** are read as tabs of the Call Register spreadsheet
  by default; if they live elsewhere set `cfg_consumption` / `cfg_feedback` or
  share the sheet.
- Role/visibility matching relies on exact `User Name` ⇄ `Call Allocated To`
  strings (case/space-insensitive). Flag any spelling mismatches.
